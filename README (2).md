
# Neural Network Model for Classification

# Overview

This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from a dataset. The model is optimized to prevent overfitting and improve accuracy by using techniques like dropout regularization and early stopping.
## Features

- Multi-layer neural network with dense layers

- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

- Different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD) for experimentation

- Early stopping mechanism

- Visualization of training and validation accuracy/loss

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10+

- TensorFlow

- Keras

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib
## Installation

IInstall Dependencies

Run the following command to install required libraries:

```bash
  pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
```
    
## DATASET


The model is trained on a dataset, ensuring proper preprocessing such as normalization and reshaping before feeding into the neural network.
## Model Architecture

- Input Layer: Accepts preprocessed image data

- Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation

- Dropout Layers: Applied to reduce overfitting

- Output Layer: Softmax activation for multi-class classification
## Training the model

```bash
  history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    epochs=30,
                    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
                    batch_size=64,
                    callbacks=[early_stopping])
```
## Evaluating the Model

```bash
  test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%")
```
## Plot Training Progress

```bash
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_history(history):
    plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
    plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
    plt.xlabel('Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

plot_history(history)
```






## USAGE

1. Clone the repository

```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
cd Neural_Network_Project
```
2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
  python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the training script:

```bash
  python train_model.py
```


## Issues and Fixes

- Overfitting: Addressed using dropout layers and early stopping.

- ModuleNotFoundError: Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.

- Shape Mismatch: Verify input shapes match expected dimensions.
## Conclusions

This project demonstrates an optimized neural network for classification tasks. Further improvements can include hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and experimenting with convolutional layers.
